# disk_show_reporter
Grabs the path to the disk and publishes the total amount of storage each folder has, with the percentage it has. It also publishes if any storage exceeds the softcap limit.

The purpose of this code is an exercise to create a disk storage management script that checks the total storage each show has and the amount of usage each is having. This is a practice code exercise in object-oriented Programming using Python for render wrangler and technical assistant tasks.

This object-oriented programming uses __main__ to run the software when you automatically run the disk_management.py
The variable it needs is a Linux path to your show's root directory, for example
'/home/user/shows/'
